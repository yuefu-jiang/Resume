# Experience
## Bioinformatic Analyst at *Cellmax Life*: Feb 2019 - Current
#### Create, improve, and run analysis pipelines and workflows to identify clinically relevant genetic mutations from genomic sequencing data ####
- With practice of cloud computing (AWS suite), encooperate and implement bioinformatics tools into the analysis pipeline. Analyze and review genome sequencing results for patient data with clinical ramifications; create and maintain databases for tracking quality data and results. Troubleshooting analysis pipeline and tools errors that occur in production pipelines.
#### Assist assay developement with bioinformatics analysis: R&D projects ####
- Evaluate and present the output of analysis pipelines with quality assurance reports that visualize trends of metrics, pointing possible components indicating imporovemnet/deterioation of the assay performance in a scientific context; data mining vast amount of sequencing data for key data points to drive product development and scientific inquiry. Write programs or scripts to analyze data using statistical packages and other software tools and libraries. 
#### Report production of clinically/commercially validated assay #### 
- Under CAP lab regulations, deliver variant calling results and QC designated report format. Write SOPs and validation reports for regulatory documentation for bioinformatics processes and results.

## Research Assistant at *Vascular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Brett A. Kaufman Lab*: APR 2015 â€“ APR 2018
#### Research projects on pathways of mitochonrdia activities in relation of diseases
- Conduct independent research on relationships between vascular disease and mitochondrial genomes. Multiple bench-top workflows conducted independently. Operate/program TECAN robotics. Regular scientific presentations were given to peer scientists for progress updates. Independent projects with bioinformatic development and analysis.
